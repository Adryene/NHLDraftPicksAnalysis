# NHL Draft Picks Data Analysis Project made with Python and JupyterLab

## NHL Draft Picks Analysis for 2018 - 2023 [Source](https://records.nhl.com/draft/draft-picks?year=2023) 

This project digs deeper into NHL Draft Picks data from 2018 to 2023 using Python, Pandas and JupyterLab. 

This analysis uses a dataset 21x larger than my previous NHL Draft First Pick project and incorporates descriptive statistics, correlations, and counts to explore trends.
