# NHL Draft Picks Data Analysis Project made with Python and JupyterLab

## NHL Draft Picks Analysis for 2018 - 2023 [Source](https://records.nhl.com/draft/draft-picks?year=2023) 

This project digs deeper into NHL Draft Picks data from 2018 to 2023 using Python, Pandas and JupyterLab. 

This analysis uses a dataset 21x larger than my previous NHL Draft First Pick project and incorporates descriptive statistics, correlations, and counts to explore trends.
## Summary 
This project is about analyzing the NHL draft picks from 2018 to 2023. The data was collected from various sources and stored in an Excel file. The project uses Python and pandas to read, manipulate, and visualize the data. The project explores various aspects of the data, such as:

  * The distribution of players by position, country, team, height, and weight.
  * The average height and weight of players by year, position, country, and team.
  * The correlation between height and weight for each position, team, and year.
  * The trends and outliers in the data.

The project aims to provide some insights into the NHL draft process and the characteristics of the drafted players. The project also demonstrates some basic data analysis skills using Python and pandas.
